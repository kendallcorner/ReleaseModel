List of Hydrogen scenarios

 - Vent stack
    --> Vessel or process piping
        --> PSV or RD or PV (orifice model)
            --> Vent header (pipe head loss)
                --> Vent stack (orifice model? and/or pipe head loss)
                    --> Vent (release model (angular issues?))

* May not all be necessary if 3% and back pressure rules are followed.
    - how to calc backpressure?
    - inputs could be pressure drop and backpressure
    - part of this is flarenet.


 - With Flow
    --> Vessel (or skip--where is your pressure measurement coming  from?)
        --> Piping (pipe head loss) (or skip--where is your pressure measurement coming  from?)
            --> Leak (orifice model, probably)
            --> Rupture (if direct from veseel?; if from piping, orifice model?)
                --> Is Flow more or less than release rate?

 - Without Flow
    --> Vessel (or skip--where is your pressure measurement coming  from?)
        --> Piping (orifice model? and/or pipe head loss) (or skip--where is your pressure measurement coming  from?)
            --> Leak (orifice model, probably)
            --> Rupture (if direct from veseel?; if from piping, orifice model?)








Forget about thermo mixing rules and just do single component
    - Still need a thermo library and data for your single components for this.

Markov analysis?
